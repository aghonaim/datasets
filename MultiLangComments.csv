1102,shipping,Insufficient packaging,"I ordered three widgets last week and just received them. I am VERY disappointed in the way they were packed. The box was only about two thirds full of packing peanuts and the widgets were not individually wrapped. As a result they were able to bump up against each other while in transit. The display on one doesn't work at all and the other two are quite scratched up (look like they have been in service for years) though they do work fine. I have always been satisifed with your service and trust you will make this right, but I suggest you look into how you are packing these items. You will have a lot of unhappy customers otherwise.","Encomendei três widgets na semana passada e os recebi. Estou muito decepcionado com a forma como eles foram embalados. A caixa tinha apenas dois terços da embalagem de amendoins e os widgets não foram embalados individualmente. Como resultado, eles foram capazes de se chocar enquanto estavam em trânsito. A tela de um não funciona e os outros dois estão bem arranhados (parece que estão em serviço há anos), embora funcionem bem. Sempre fiquei satisfeito com seu serviço e confio em que você fará isso direito, mas sugiro que verifique como está embalando esses itens. Caso contrário, você terá muitos clientes insatisfeitos."
1103,fulfillment,Wrong items again,"Can't believe you fools shipped me the wrong items AGAIN. If you weren't the only company I've been able to find that even has these items, I would have stopped ordering from you a long time ago. I order weekly and it seems like at least once a month my order has some kind of foul-up. Waiting for the order to be corrected would set my business back so I need to keep extra on hand just in case. Not fair for me to have to carry extra inventory to make up for YOUR screw-ups! Hire someone who can tell the difference between a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit. If anyone reading this knows of another source please let me know.","Can't believe you fools shipped me the wrong items AGAIN.

1104,praise,Fantastic!,"Wow! I had NO IDEA that reciprocating garombles of such high quality even existed! And they're a steal, too; I've paid twice your asking price for garombles that weren't nearly as smooth in operation. Free ground delivery was a plus (the overnight shipping seems a little spendy though). We'll see how these actually hold up, but so far I'm sold!","Wow!

1105,fulfillment,Re: Wrong items again,"Jake, I've had similar problems tracking down another source of thingamabobs. (Or is it whatchamacallits you need?) I have found Contoso Supply to have thingamabobs but not reliably.

1109,techsupport,Problems with retro-encabulator,"Hi folks. According to your encabulator brochure, the hydrocoptic marzlevanes are supposed to prevent side fumbling. In fact, I bought your retro-encabulator because of your claims that it was highly resistant to this problem. However, I'm seeing a lot of side fumbling anyway. Am I doing something wrong or do I have a defective unit?","Hola amigos. De acuerdo con el folleto de su encabulador, se supone que los marzlevanos hidrocópticos previenen la caída lateral. De hecho, compré su retroencapsulador debido a sus afirmaciones de que era muy resistente a este problema. Sin embargo, de todos modos estoy viendo muchos problemas. ¿Estoy haciendo algo mal o tengo una unidad defectuosa?"

1113,techsupport,Re: Problems with retro-encabulator,"Susan, the hydrocoptic marzlevanes MUST be fitted properly to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft to prevent side fumbling. Please see page 42 of the manual for an illustration of proper fitment. Also, as mentioned on page 65, after the 24-hour break-in period, you will probably want to re-adjust the marzlevanes for optimum performance. Remember, our standard warranty includes one complimentary service call in the first week to resolve setup issues. If you continue to have trouble, don't hesitate to use it! Our technician will certainly be able to diagnose side-fumbling issues, and, should your encabulator prove defective (it does rarely happen) will install a replacement.","Susan, the hydrocoptic marzlevanes MUST be fitted properly to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft to prevent side fumbling.

1114,techsupport,Re: Problems with retro-encabulator,Have you tried turning it off and back on again? The encabulator runs a self-calibration at each power-up that may help reduce side fumbling.,"Haben Sie versucht, es aus- und wieder einzuschalten?

1121,suggestion,Gizmo colors,"Hi, have you ever considered making gizmos in colors other than chartreuse and magenta? I think gray or black would be useful, particularly in a matte finish. Your gizmos are only one small part of our contraption, which has a rather sedate design, and they really clash. We keep using them because they're the most reliable we've found, but our customers keep asking why they're like that! We considered repainting them, but that's a LOT of work considering the intricacy of their design.","Hej, har du nogensinde overvejet at lave gizmos i andre farver end chartreuse og magenta? Jeg tror, ​​at gråt eller sort ville være nyttigt, især i en mat finish. Dine gizmos er kun en lille del af vores kontrast, som har et ret sedat design, og de kolliderer virkelig. Vi bruger dem fortsat, fordi de er de mest pålidelige, vi har fundet, men vores kunder spørger stadig, hvorfor de er sådan! Vi overvejede at male dem igen, men det er MEGET arbejde i betragtning af det komplicerede ved deres design."
